# Gilded Rose Tech Test
My attempt at the [Gilded Rose](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata) code kata, in Ruby. It's a kata based on refactoring: terrible legacy code is provided, the goal is to improve it and then add a new feature.

# Description
The specification can be found [here](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/master/GildedRoseRequirements.txt). The code belongs to a magical inn, the Gilded Rose. It relates to inventory and item sell by dates. It starts with two classes, Item, and GildedRose. The Item class mustn't be edited.
